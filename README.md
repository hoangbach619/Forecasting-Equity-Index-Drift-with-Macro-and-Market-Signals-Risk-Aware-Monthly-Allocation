# Forecasting-Equity-Index-Drift-with-Macro-and-Market-Signals-Risk-Aware-Monthly-Allocation

This research develops a machine learning framework to predict monthly returns of SPY and QQQ indices through ensemble models combined with dynamic position sizing. The results are quite interesting, despite achieving weak predictive correlations, the strategy still produced respectable Sharpe ratios of 0.579 and 0.404. This finding suggests that how positions are sized can be more important than getting high accuracy prediction. The research uses 376 monthly observations from April 1994 to July 2025. Starting with 91 features extracted from market data, economic surprises, and technical indicators, it reduced to 35 features using correlation-based pruning to avoid overfitting. The ensemble approach weights Ridge regression at 8%, ElasticNet at 7%, Random Forest at 25%, XGBoost at 35%, and LightGBM at 25%. Then, it applied Kalman filtering to smooth out the noisy predictions. The key contribution is demonstrating that position sizing through tanh activation function matters more than prediction accuracy for generating returns. Monte Carlo simulations show only a 13.1% probability of loss over 12 months, supporting the effectiveness of this risk management approach. These findings challenge the traditional view that profitable trading requires highly accurate predictions.<img width="468" height="221" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb355fca-69bd-4c91-9be9-bc49d77e435e" />
